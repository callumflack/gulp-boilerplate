Gulp Boilerplate
================

Forked from Drew Barontini's [boilerplate](https://github.com/drewbarontini/noise), then adapted for my basic needs.


What does this particular Gulp setup do?
----------------------------------------

- Watches and compiles Sass and JavaScript files
- Minifies CSS and JavaScript files
- Lints JavasScript and Sass files
- Tests CSS file using `csscss` and `parker`
- Tests JavaScript file using `jshint`
- Removes unused CSS with uncss
- Runs Autoprefixer on CSS
- Compiles multiple SVG icons into one SVG file

Setup
-----

```
$ npm install
```
